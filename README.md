# Predicting Time Required for Ukhamba - Inkabi Zezwe to Achieve Gold Status

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the time it would take for the album of the artist Ukhamba - Inkabi Zezwe to achieve gold status based on the certification standards set by the Recording Industry of South Africa (RISA).

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide insights into the time required for Ukhamba - Inkabi Zezwe to achieve gold status by leveraging historical data, including release dates, streaming counts, and certification statuses.

## Approach
The project follows the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather historical data on Ukhamba - Inkabi Zezwe, including relevant information such as release dates, streaming counts, and certification statuses.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning steps, handle missing values, and format inconsistencies in the data.

3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the data that could impact the time required for achieving gold status. Examples include the number of streams, the artist's previous certifications, and the time since release.

4. Data Analysis and Visualization: Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of the data and identify any patterns or correlations. Visualize the data using line plots or bar charts.

5. Model Training: Utilize machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression to train models using the historical data.

6. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

7. Predictive Analysis: Apply the best-performing model to predict the time required for Ukhamba - Inkabi Zezwe to achieve gold status based on the input data for their latest release.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Collect the historical data on Ukhamba - Inkabi Zezwe, including release dates, streaming counts, and certification statuses.

2. Preprocess the data by cleaning it and handling missing values.

3. Perform feature engineering to extract relevant features.

4. Train the machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression, using the provided code.

5. Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

6. Choose the best-performing model based on the evaluation results.

7. Use the chosen model to predict the time required for Ukhamba - Inkabi Zezwe to achieve gold status based on the input data for their latest release.
